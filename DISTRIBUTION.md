# How to Install GitHub Stack Detector (Manual Installation)

Since this extension is not on the Chrome Web Store, you can install it manually in Developer Mode. It's safe, free, and takes about 30 seconds.

## Prerequisites

- Google Chrome, Brave, Edge, or any Chromium-based browser.
- The `github-stack-detector-1.0.0-chrome.zip` file (Download it from Releases).

## Installation Steps

1.  **Unzip the file**: Extract the downloaded `.zip` file to a folder on your computer. You should see a folder containing `manifest.json` and other files.
2.  **Open Extensions Page**:
    *   In Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
    *   Or go to the menu (three dots) > **Extensions** > **Manage Extensions**.
3.  **Enable Developer Mode**:
    *   Look for a toggle switch named **"Developer mode"** in the top-right corner of the page.
    *   Turn it **ON**.
4.  **Load Unpacked**:
    *   Click the **"Load unpacked"** button that appears in the top-left key bar.
    *   Select the **folder** you extracted in Step 1.
5.  **Done!**
    *   The extension should now appear in your list.
    *   Pin it to your toolbar to use it!

## Updating

If a new version is released:
1.  Download and unzip the new version.
2.  Go to `chrome://extensions` and click **"Remove"** on the old version (or just overwrite the old folder content).
3.  Load the new folder as unpacked again.
